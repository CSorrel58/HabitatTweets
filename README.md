# HabitatTweets
Analysis of Habitat for Humanity's Social Media
This Repository contains my work on looking at Habitat for Humanity's tweets to see what drove their success. 
-The jupyter noteboook contains how I scraped this data using the Tweepy API and then generated a wordcloud of all of their tweets and a wordcloud of their top tweets.
-The .png has both wordclouds side by side for easy comparision.
-The csv contains the exported data - all of this information was what Habitat_org had posted on Twitter and was publicly available.
